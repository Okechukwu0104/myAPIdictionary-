# myAPIdictionary-
This is just my first main project....im new to this

Its a Command-line Dictionary: I was told to build a command-line dictionary app that fetches word
definitions or translations from an API using Node.js' built-in http module and displays
them to the user.But even though this is just an assignment, i feel something DIFFERENT can come out of this evetually. 
I would really appreciate collaboration.
